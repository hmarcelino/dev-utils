# Usage: $_SUB_NAME commands
# Summary: List all $_SUB_NAME commands
# Group: Sub Internals
# Help: This command is mostly used for autocompletion in various shells, and for `$_SUB_NAME help`.
# Also, this command helps find commands that are named the same as potentially builtin shell commands (which, cd, etc)
